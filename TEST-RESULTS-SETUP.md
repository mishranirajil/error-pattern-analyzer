# Test Results Setup Guide

This document explains how to fix the GitHub Actions test result publishing issue.

## Problem Fixed

The original GitHub Actions workflow was failing with two issues:

1. **No test result files found**: `Could not find any files for **/TestResults/**/*.trx`
2. **Permission denied**: `403 Forbidden` when trying to create check runs

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Test Command
Changed the test step in `.github/workflows/build.yml` to generate TRX files:

```yaml
- name: Test
  run: dotnet test ErrorPatternAnalyzer.sln --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity normal --logger "trx;LogFileName=TestResults.trx" --results-directory "TestResults"
```

### 2. Added Required Permissions
Added necessary permissions to the workflow job:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  checks: write
  pull-requests: write
```

### 3. Updated Action Configuration
Enhanced the publish test results action:

```yaml
- name: Publish Test Results
  uses: EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v2
  if: always()
  with:
    files: '**/TestResults/**/*.trx'
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Verification

Local test run successfully generates the required TRX file:
- ✅ TestResults/TestResults.trx created
- ✅ 5 tests executed successfully
- ✅ Results properly formatted for GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

When you push these changes to GitHub, the workflow should now:
1. Generate proper TRX test result files
2. Successfully publish test results to GitHub
3. Create check runs with test summaries
4. Show test results in pull requests

The workflow is now properly configured to work with the EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v2.
